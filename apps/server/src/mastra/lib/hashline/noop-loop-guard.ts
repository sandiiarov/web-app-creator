 * no-ops for the same (path, payload) key, `observe` throws a hard tool error
 * so the agent is forced to stop and re-read instead of churning.
 *
 * The key is (canonicalPath, payload-hash): a genuine new edit (different
 * payload) or an edit to a different file resets the counter for that key,
 * and any real mutation clears the counter for that path+payload.
